 Readme file for PGPfone 2.1 source code
 ---------------------------------------

This is the source code for PGPfone version 2.1, for the Macintosh and
for Windows.

I developed PGPfone with Will Price and others before starting my
company, PGP Inc, in 1996.  After the company was formed, I assigned
all my rights to this software to the company.  Unfortunately, the
company never showed much interest in the product, despite the fact
that I was chairman.  The reason is that the company specifically
targeted its marketing efforts only  at corporate IT departments, and
that market was not interested in PGPfone.  After PGPfone 2.0 was
released (due to my personal efforts to push the company to develop
PGPfone at least to the 2.0 release), all development stopped and the
product was neglected.  Later, when Network Associates (NAI) acquired
PGP Inc in December 1997, the product became even more neglected.
NAI was even more focused on the corporate IT market.

Will Price continued small amounts of development effort in his spare
time, resulting in PGPfone 2.1.  But we could not get NAI to release
it, due to the costs of releasing a product, and the fact that version
2.1 still had some bugs that would have held up release.

Rather than let PGPfone die completely, Will and I decided to release
the source code, which we did when NAI published the source code for
PGP 6.5.1.  Because of US export restrictions on cryptographic software,
NAI publishes PGP releases in printed book form.  We just printed an
extra volume with the PGPfone source code and bundled that book with
the rest of the books in the PGP 6.5.1 source code set.  After the
books were OCR-scanned in Europe, the source code was published on the
PGP International Home Page at www.pgpi.org in Norway.  Although NAI
is releasing the source code, the source code is still copyrighted by
NAI, and cannot be used without permission.

Now that the source code for PGPfone is finally published, we can get
help from others who want to make improvements and fix bugs in PGPfone.
If anyone wants to do any development work to make improvements to this
code, please contact me personally at prz@pgp.com.  You can also find
my phone number on my web page at www.pgp.com/phil.
